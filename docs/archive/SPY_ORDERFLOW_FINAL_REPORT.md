## üí™ Enhanced Orderflow Components Performance

### 1. Break of Structure (BOS) Detection
- **Strong BOS (>0.01)**: 68.8% win rate vs 48.4% for weak BOS
- **Performance Improvement**: 42% higher win rate with strong BOS signals
- **Key Insight**: IamZeroIka's 1/3 body close validation rule effectively filters quality breakouts

### 2. Intent Conviction Analysis
- **Medium/High Conviction**: 66.7% win rate (12 trades)
- **Low Conviction**: 51.4% win rate (35 trades)
- **CVD Integration**: Successfully identifies trap reversals and true market intent

### 3. Liquidity Sweep Detection
- **Crypto Chase Logic**: Implemented fake breakout detection
- **Moneytaur Insights**: Liquidity pump detection in bear flow scenarios
- **Result**: Reduced false signals and improved entry timing
