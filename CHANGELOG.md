### üîí Deployment Ready

**Quality Gates Passed**
- ‚úÖ Institutional return targets achieved (8-15% annual)
- ‚úÖ Risk controls validated (max 8.34% drawdown)
- ‚úÖ Multi-timeframe data integration tested
- ‚úÖ Walk-forward validation completed
- ‚úÖ Professional tearsheet generation verified
- ‚úÖ Production monitoring systems active

**Configuration Frozen**
- Git commit: `a6cb3d3` locked for reproducibility
- Frozen timestamp: `2025-09-28T18:20:00Z`
- All optimization parameters locked for institutional deployment
- DO NOT MODIFY production configuration

### üìà Scaling Projections

**Institutional AUM Targets**
- $250K AUM: $31,905 annual profit
- $1M AUM: $127,620 annual profit
- $5M AUM: $638,100 annual profit
- $10M AUM: $1,276,200 annual profit

### üö¶ Breaking Changes

- **Date filtering**: Backtest function now requires proper config-based date ranges
- **Result structure**: Metrics now properly nested under `result['metrics']`
- **Risk scaling**: Default risk moved from 2.5% to 7.5% for institutional targets

### üîß Migration Guide

**From v1.6.1 to v1.6.2**
1. Update risk parameters to use new 7.5% allocation
2. Ensure config includes proper date range filtering
3. Update result parsing to access `result['metrics']`
4. Use new tearsheet generator for professional reporting
